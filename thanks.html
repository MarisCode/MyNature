                    <p class="thanks">Thank you Dad for giving me your helping hand by letting me borrow your photographs for this project. I can't imagine any other photos that could have conveyed the atmosphere I was looking for. I appreciate your ability to see the forest from the trees and the tree from the forest - and capture it all into breathtaking pictures.</p>    
                    <p class="thanks">I also want to thank you for raising me to love and respect nature. I have been privileged to see and experience the beauty of the forests, lakes, swamps and archipelago with you. You have given me the framework that has allowed me to build my own relationship with nature.</p>
                    <p class="thanks">I love you.</p>
